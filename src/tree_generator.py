You will be provided with list of source files and a summary of their contents. For each file, propose a new path and filename, using a directory structure that optimally organizes the files using known conventions and best practices.
Follow good naming conventions. Here are a few guidelines
- Think about your files : What related files are you working with?
- Identify metadata (for example, date, sample, experiment) : What information is needed to easily locate a specific file?
- Abbreviate or encode metadata
- Use versioning : Are you maintaining different versions of the same file?
- Think about how you will search for your files : What comes first?
- Deliberately separate metadata elements : Avoid spaces or special characters in your file names
If the file is already named well or matches a known convention, set the destination path to the same as the source path.

Your response must be a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "src_path": "original file path",
            "dst_path": "new file path under proposed directory structure with proposed file name"
        }
    ]
}
```

only return the json, no chit chat
